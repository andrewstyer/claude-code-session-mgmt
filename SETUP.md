# Setup Guide - Adapting This Toolkit to Your Project

**Follow these steps to customize the toolkit for your specific project**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This toolkit needs to be customized for your project before use. The customization process takes **30-60 minutes** and involves:

1. Filling out PROJECT-CONFIG.md with your project details
2. Customizing the workflow documents with your specifics
3. Setting up git hooks
4. Testing the workflow

---

```bash
# From your project root directory
cp -r /Users/andrewstyer/dev/dev-toolkit/* .

# Verify files copied
ls -la
# You should see:
# - START-HERE.md
# - CONTINUE-SESSION.md
# - END-SESSION.md
# - SESSION-STATUS.md
# - RECOVERY.md
# - PROMPTS.md
# - PROJECT-CONFIG.md
# - SETUP.md

## Step 4: Customize CONTINUE-SESSION.md (5 minutes)

Open `CONTINUE-SESSION.md` and update:

### Commands Section

Replace with your actual commands:

```bash
# Old (generic)
npm test
npm start

# New (your project)
python -m pytest
python manage.py runserver
```

### Quick Reference Section

Update paths to your actual documentation:

```bash
# Old
- Architecture: `docs/plans/architecture.md`

# New
- Architecture: `docs/architecture/system-design.md`
```

---

## Step 5: Customize END-SESSION.md (5 minutes)

Open `END-SESSION.md` and update:

### Step 1: Quality Checks

Replace commands with yours:

```bash
# Replace generic commands
npm test -- --coverage
maestro test .maestro/
npx tsc --noEmit

# With your commands
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html
mypy src/
cargo build
```

### Coverage Threshold

Update if different from 80%:

```bash
# Old
# Must show: >80% coverage

# New (if using 90%)
# Must show: >90% coverage
```

---

## Step 6: Customize SESSION-STATUS.md (10 minutes)

Open `SESSION-STATUS.md` and update:

### Quick Context Section

Replace placeholders:

```markdown
**What we're building:** {{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}

**Current status:** [BRIEF SUMMARY]

**Next task:** Task [X.X.X] from `{{TASK_BREAKDOWN_DOC}}`
```

### Completed Work Section

Replace with your actual phases/tasks:

```markdown
### Phase 1: {{PHASE_1_NAME}} âœ… COMPLETE

## Step 8: Customize PROMPTS.md (10 minutes)

Open `PROMPTS.md` and update all four prompts:

### First Session Prompt

Replace placeholders:

```
I need you to build the {{PROJECT_NAME}} {{PROJECT_TYPE}} following the
comprehensive implementation plan in this repository.

Key Context:
- Tech stack: {{TECH_STACK}}
- Architecture: {{ARCHITECTURE_PATTERN}}
- Testing: {{TESTING_APPROACH}}
- Timeline: {{IMPLEMENTATION_TIMELINE}}
```

### All Prompts

Update quality check commands in all prompts:

```bash
# Old
npm test -- --coverage
maestro test .maestro/
npx tsc --noEmit

# New
pytest --cov=.
mypy src/
black --check src/
```

---

## Step 9: Set Up Git Hooks (5 minutes)

### Option A: Use Provided Hook (Recommended)

```bash
# Install the pre-commit hook
cd git-hooks
./setup-git-hooks.sh
cd ..

# Test it
git add .
git commit -m "test: verify git hook works"
# Should prompt about SESSION-STATUS.md
```

### Option B: Customize Hook First

Open `git-hooks/pre-commit` and update:

- Test commands (if not npm/node project)
- Type check commands
- File patterns to watch

Then install:

```bash
cd git-hooks
./setup-git-hooks.sh
cd ..
```

---

## Step 10: Verify Setup (10 minutes)

ls {{SOURCE_DIR}}
ls {{DOCS_DIR}}
ls {{TEST_DIR}}

# Verify git hook installed
ls -la .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

---

## Step 11: Create Your First Session (5 minutes)

### Update README.md

Add a "Quick Start for Developers" section pointing to the workflow docs:

```markdown
## ðŸš€ Quick Start for Developers

**ðŸ“‹ For Claude Code Users:** See `PROMPTS.md` for ready-to-use session prompts

### First-Time Developer (Starting from Scratch)

**Read this first:** `START-HERE.md`

### Continuing Developer (Work Already Started)

**Read this first:** `CONTINUE-SESSION.md` (2-minute brief)

**Then read:** `SESSION-STATUS.md` (see what's done, what's next)

### Ending Any Session (Required Before Stopping)

**Read this before ending:** `END-SESSION.md` (mandatory checklist)
```

### Test First Session

Give Claude Code the First Session Prompt from `PROMPTS.md`:

```
I need you to build the {{YOUR_PROJECT_NAME}} ...
[Copy from PROMPTS.md]
```

Verify Claude:
1. Reads START-HERE.md
2. Creates TodoWrite todos
3. Begins implementation

---

## ðŸš€ You're Ready!

Once the checklist is complete, you can:

1. **Start first session:** Give Claude Code the First Session Prompt
2. **Continue sessions:** Use Continuing Session Prompt
3. **End sessions:** Use End Session Prompt (mandatory)
4. **Recover from issues:** Give Claude the Recovery Prompt

---

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Success

### Keep It Updated

As your project evolves:
- Update phases in SESSION-STATUS.md
- Add new recovery scenarios to RECOVERY.md
- Adjust quality gates if standards change
- Update documentation paths

### Enforce Session Handoff

The git hook helps, but also:
- Set calendar reminders to use END-SESSION.md
- Make it a ritual: "Before I close this tab..."
- Review SESSION-STATUS.md at start of each session

### Document Lessons Learned

When you discover:
- New recovery scenarios
- Better workflow patterns
- Project-specific gotchas

Add them to RECOVERY.md or your project docs.

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting Setup

### "I don't know what to put for {{PLACEHOLDER}}"

**Common issues:**

**{{ARCHITECTURE_PATTERN}}** - If you don't know yet:
- Put "To be determined" or "Standard MVC" or "Modular monolith"
- Update later when architecture solidifies

**{{IMPLEMENTATION_TIMELINE}}** - If unknown:
- Estimate based on scope: "6-8 weeks" or "3 months to MVP"
- Adjust later as needed

**{{PHASE_COUNT}}** - If no phases defined:
- Break project into logical phases: Setup â†’ Core â†’ Features â†’ Polish
- Start with 4-6 phases

### "My project doesn't use npm/node"

**No problem!** Just replace commands:

**Python:**
```bash
pytest                   # instead of npm test
mypy src/               # instead of npx tsc
black --check src/      # instead of npm run lint
```

**Go:**
```bash
go test ./...           # instead of npm test
golangci-lint run       # instead of npx tsc
go build ./cmd/app      # instead of npm run build
```

**Rust:**
```bash
cargo test              # instead of npm test
cargo clippy            # instead of npx tsc
cargo build             # instead of npm run build
```

### "I don't have E2E tests"

Update END-SESSION.md and PROMPTS.md:

```bash
# Remove or comment out
# maestro test .maestro/

# Or replace with your E2E tool
# playwright test
# cypress run
```
