## üìã Session Handoff Checklist

### üõë BEFORE ENDING YOUR SESSION (MANDATORY)

**Run this checklist - DO NOT SKIP:**

```bash
# 1. Verify all tests pass
{{TEST_COMMAND}}
# Must show: all passing

# 2. Verify coverage meets threshold
{{COVERAGE_COMMAND}}
# Must show: >{{COVERAGE_THRESHOLD}}%

# 3. Verify no type errors
{{TYPE_CHECK_COMMAND}}
# Must show: no errors

# 4. Verify build succeeds
{{BUILD_COMMAND}}
# Must show: successful

# 5. Check git status
git status
# Should be clean or intentional changes only
```

**Then update this file:**
- [ ] Update "Last Updated" date at top
- [ ] Update "Current Phase" and "Last Developer" at top
- [ ] Check/uncheck completed tasks in "Completed Work"
- [ ] Update "Current Work" ‚Üí "Last commit" with your latest commit
- [ ] Update "Current Work" ‚Üí "Next immediate steps"
- [ ] Update "Test Status" with actual numbers
- [ ] Add any new issues to "Known Issues / Blockers"
- [ ] Update "Notes for Next Developer"

**Finally, commit this file:**
```bash
git add SESSION-STATUS.md
git commit -m "docs: update session status after [brief description]"
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL:** If you don't update this file, the next developer will waste time!

# 3. Verify working state
git status
# Should be clean to start fresh

# 4. Verify tests still pass
{{TEST_COMMAND}}
# Ensure starting from working state

# 5. Start dev server (if needed)
{{DEV_SERVER_COMMAND}}
# Keep running in separate terminal
```
